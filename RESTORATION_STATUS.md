# Project Restoration Status

## ✅ MINIMUM VIABLE APP - COMPLETE

The app can now run! All critical files have been created.

### What's Working:
- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ Navigation system functional
- ✅ All 6 screens created (basic versions)
- ✅ Configuration and theme setup
- ✅ TypeScript types defined

### What's Currently Basic (Placeholder):
- ⚠️ Screens show basic UI only (title + subtitle)
- ⚠️ No camera, voice, or AI features yet
- ⚠️ No components (VoiceButton, ModeCard, etc.)
- ⚠️ No services fully implemented

## Next Steps (Optional):

If you want the FULL features from before the Ctrl+Z:
1. I can continue adding all ~40 remaining files with complete functionality
2. Or you can test this basic version first
